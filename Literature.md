Investor Attention and Stock Market Volatility (Andrei and Hasler 2015)
In a theoretical framework, they study the joint role played by investors’ attention to
news and learning uncertainty in determining asset prices. The model provides two main
predictions. First, stock return variance and risk premia increase with both attention and
uncertainty. Second, this increasing relationship is quadratic. They empirically test these two
predictions, and show that the data from Google Trends provide evidence of the increasing relationship.

Forecasting volatility with empirical similarity and Google Trends (Hamid and Heiden, 2015)
They forecast volatility using Google search frequency as measure of investor attention. Using a model of empirical similarity in an out-of-sample framework, the model significantly outperforms conventional time-series models on short horizons. And predictive accuracy increases with investor attention in crisis periods.

Financial Attention (Sicherman et al., 2015)
The paper investigates financial attention using novel panel data on daily investor online account logins. They find support for selective attention to portfolio information. Account logins fall by 9.5% after market declines. Investors also pay less attention when the VIX volatility index is high. The level of attention and the attention/return correlation are strongly related to investor demographics (gender, age) and financial position (wealth, holdings). Using a new statistical decomposition, they show how aggregate and individual household trading are related to investor attention.

Information demand and stock return predictability (Chronopoulosa et al., 2017)
They show that volatility forecasts can be improved by using Google’s daily internet search volume index. And the sign of S&P 500 stock returns can be predictable. The profitable strategies can be constructed by using the search volume index. And results are robust to different levels of risk aversion and transaction costs.

Twitter mood predicts the stock market (Bollen et al. 2011)
They analyze the text content of daily Twitter feeds by two mood tracking tools, namely OpinionFinder that measures positive vs. negative mood and Google-Profile of Mood States (GPOMS) that measures mood in terms of 6 dimensions (Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital, Kind, and Happy). A Granger causality analysis and a Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Network are then used to investigate the hypothesis that public mood states, as measured by the OpinionFinder and GPOMS mood time series, are predictive
of changes in DJIA closing values.

Can social microblogging be used to forecast intraday exchange rates? (Papaioannou et al., 2013)
They use time series and trading simulations analysis, and provide some evidence that the information provided in social microblogging platforms such as Twitter can in certain cases enhance the forecasting efficiency regarding the very short (intradaily) forex.

A Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Content as a Predictor of Exchange Rate Movements (Ozturk and Ciftci, 2014)
They investigate the relationship between Twitter content categorized as sentiments, such as Buy, Sell and Neutral, with USD/TRY currency movements. The results suggest that there exists a relationship between the number of tweets and the change in USD/TRY exchange rate.

Market sentiment and exchange rate directional forecasting (Plakandaras et al., 2015)
They focus on investors' sentiment on a given exchange rate as a possible predictor of its future evolution. As a proxy of investors' sentiment we use StockTwits posts, a message board dedicated to finance. Within StockTwits investors are asked to explicitly state their market expectations. They use the daily data on the nominal exchange rate of four currencies against the U.S. dollar and the extracted market sentiment for the year 2013. Employing econometric and machine learning methodologies we develop models that forecast in out-of-sample exercise the future direction of the four exchange rates.
